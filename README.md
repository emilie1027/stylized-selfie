# neural-style

An implementation of [neural style][paper] with spatial control in TensorFlow inspired by two repositories [neural style][neural-style] and [neural style][neural-style-tf].

It supports spatial control, color control, L-BFGS[l-bfgs] and adam optimization.


## Running

`python neural_style.py --content <content file> --styles <style file> --output <output file>`

Run `python neural_style.py --help` to see a list of all options.

Use `--checkpoint-output` and `--checkpoint-iterations` to save checkpoint images.

Use `--iterations` to change the number of iterations (default 1000).  For a 512×512 pixel content file, 1000 iterations take 2.5 minutes on a GeForce GTX Titan X GPU, or 90 minutes on an Intel Core i7-5930K CPU.

## Example 1

Running it for 500-2000 iterations seems to produce nice results. With certain
images or output sizes, you might need some hyperparameter tuning (especially
`--content-weight`, `--style-weight`, and `--learning-rate`).

The following example was run for 400 iterations with default parameters to produce the result:

With spatial control:

I used self-portrait, Umberto Boccioni, 1905 as style image :

## Requirements :
* [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
* [opencv](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)

#### Optional (but recommended) dependencies:
* [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) 7.5+
* [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) 5.0+

#### After installing the dependencies: 
* Download the [VGG-19 model weights](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/) (see the "VGG-VD models from the *Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Visual Recognition* project" section). More info about the VGG-19 network can be found [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/).
* After downloading, copy the weights file `imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat` to the project directory.(https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/get_started/os_setup.html#download-and-setup)
