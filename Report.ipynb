    "# Abstract\n",
    "I build a system to create stylized portrait based on Gayts works \"A neural algorithm of Artistic style\". Once a user uploaded its selfie, the system will auto-select the top 3 matches in the arts gallery of 1000 images spanning 100 artists and create the user's portrait using styles of top matches. This system, rather than let users manually choose art style, picks the most relevant arts for the user. Thus, avoid the potential of creating bad works.\n",
